# piston-meta-arm32

This repo hosts a replacement Minecraft Java Manifest for arm32 Linux.
Minecraft has a manifest file that tells minecraft launchers where the files are located on the intenet, what files go with what version of the game, and what launch arguments to launch the game with.
See the wiki for more info: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Version_manifest.json

This repo takes advantage of this by parsing and rewriting the official meta repo for unofficial arm32 linux support.

## How to use this

Minecraft launchers can be modified to use this meta repo instead of mojangs meta repo. For open source launchers, sometimes this is as simple as changing a string from `https://launchermeta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest.json` to this manifest `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theofficialgman/piston-meta-arm32/main/mc/game/version_manifest.json` and building the launcher.
(or for the v2 version `https://launchermeta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest_v2.json` to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theofficialgman/piston-meta-arm32/main/mc/game/version_manifest_v2.json`)

## This repo uses my (theofficialgman) already existing arm32 lwjgl/jinput ports:
- LWJGL 2.9.4-nightly-20150209 (for minecraft 1.12 and older)<br>
- jinput 2.0.7 (it appears that jinput 2.0.5 from mojang is actually closer to 2.0.7) a library used for game controllers on minecraft 1.12.2 and older, tested with this mod: https://github.com/ljsimin/MinecraftJoypadSplitscreenMod<br>
- backported versions of 3.1.6, 3.2.1, and 3.2.2 for armhf/arm64 compatibility, and a spoofed 3.1.2 (for prerelease 1.13 minecraft)<br>
- official lwjgl 3.3.1 armhf/arm64 linux builds are also included for use with Minecraft 22w16a (1.19 prerelease) and newer<br>
